               Then, you can add new campgrounds, edit existing ones and delete them, as long as they were created by you. The comments part works similarly.
               The map location is also shown in the info page of each campground. The pictures are from Unsplash.com and the map location is conducted using Google map API. 
               More features and styling will be added in the future.
